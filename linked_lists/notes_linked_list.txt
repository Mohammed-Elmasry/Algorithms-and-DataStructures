some notes on construction of linked lists.


#1 don't forget to assign the members to default values (null / data member value) just after construction.

#2insertion at the beginning of a linked list is O(1) and would be O(n) otherwise (you don't need to find where to insert in the first case but that's not true otherwise).

#3 searching by a loop while the current pointer != null is O(n) as well because I don't know when I will find that cell I'm looking for.

#4 if you want 1 pointer in your code and you want it to loop on a linked list and after the loop exists, it would be standing at the end of the linked list, then check if the NEXT of that pointer is not null.

#5 linking a newly created cell to already existing lists from its side is easier and could be done as first step.

#6 trying to access the pNext/pPrev of null gives a segmentation fault error (core dumped). This
means you're trying to access a part of the memory that's not allocated.
